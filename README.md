# QDLL - Quadrature Delay Locked Loop

QDLL is a full-custom analog integrated circuit developed using the open-source SG13G2 PDK from IHP.  
The design features two parallel delay-locked loops (DLLs) targeting timing alignment and phase synchronization applications, suitable for use at ~250 MHz.

---

## 🔧 Project Goals

- Design and tapeout of a QDLL using the IHP SG13G2 130nm process.
- Validate timing alignment through post-layout simulations.
- Use only **open-source EDA tools** including Magic, KLayout, Xschem, ngspice, python tools and others.
- Participate in the UNIC-CASS tapeout program for educational and research purposes.
